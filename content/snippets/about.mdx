I've been making products on the web since circa 2012. I've worked with clients from digital agencies, nonprofits, early-stage startups, established SaaS companies and large enterprises.

Some of the companies I’ve collaborated in the recent past include [Avast](https://avast.com/), [GoodData](https://gooddata.com/), and [Phrase](https://phrase.com/).

I have a penchant for thoughtful design, clear information architecture and meticulously crafted experiences.

I approach my praxis with a critical eye, stemming from my eclectic academic background in complex systems and emergent technologies.

When I am not in front of the screen, you can find me sifting through piles of obscure books, brewing coffee, and dabbling with electronics.
