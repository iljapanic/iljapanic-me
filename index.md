Hello there online stranger.

My name is Ilja and I welcome you to my little corner of the Web.

I’m an avid student of technology and its role in society. I’m interested in a range of themes revolving around information design, HCI, computational ethics, information behaviour and ubiquitous computing.

I like to drink black coffee, play basketball, listen to eccentric music and read dense books.
